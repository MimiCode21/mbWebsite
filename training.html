              Web Development Boot camps

          <div id="flush-collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
            <div class="accordion-body">During my intensive boot camps, I successfully built a variety of websites, showcasing my skills in creating and designing web pages. These projects encompassed static, interactive, and responsive designs. <br><br>
              The first project involved developing a static platform where I utilised Bootstrap, incorporating features like carousels and icons. This experience also introduced me to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and their integration in my websites.<br><br>
              Next, I worked on a website for a tea company, further exploring Bootstrap and its design templates.<br><br>
              Another website I worked on involved implementing creative design concepts using platforms like Canva. Additionally, I created a bookings and confirmation page, gaining experience in form usage and the utilisation of submit buttons.<br><br>
              For a cake company, I designed a web page allowing customers to submit custom orders, including pictures and ideas.<br><br>
              To showcase my design skills, I created an email template for an ice cream company. This project allowed me to experiment with different layouts, understanding the role of positioning, imagery, and fonts in capturing consumers' attention.<br>
              In a collaborative project, I contributed to building a fruit salad builder utilising an API. This exposed me to working with JSON and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.<br><br>
              For my final projects, I developed three games: an interactive drum kit, a dice rolling game, and a memory game. These projects involved event listeners, switch statements, callbacks, and adding animations to the websites. I further honed my JavaScript skills, including working with jQuery, higher order functions, and manipulating elements using the DOM.<br><br>
              Throughout my journey, I gained proficiency in using the command line and uploading my work via GitHub. GitHub proved invaluable for collaboration projects, solidifying my understanding of branching and merging.<br><br>
              By leveraging effective user interface principles, frameworks like Bootstrap, and careful attention management, I successfully completed these engaging projects.
